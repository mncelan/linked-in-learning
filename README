Docker:

If you already have postgres running on your local you need to stop it for the docker one to run
with no errors like below:

psql: error: FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "postgres"
FATAL:  password authentication failed for user "postgres"

To check status/stop/start local postgres:
# sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql stop/status/start

Restart Docker

#sudo systemctl restart docker

Permissions denied while creating a script

#sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
